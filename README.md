# Node.js HTTP Module Activities
This repository contains all the practice activities I did while learning and exploring the **HTTP module** in Node.js.

---
````````````````````````

##  What is inside?

The repository includes examples covering:

- **Creating a simple HTTP server**
  - Using `http.createServer` to handle requests and responses
- **Routing basics**
  - Handling different URLs (e.g., `/`, `/about`, `/contact`)
- **Serving HTML content**
  - Sending plain text, JSON, or HTML responses
- **Handling status codes**
  - Sending proper HTTP response codes (200, 404, etc.)
- **Working with request and response objects**
  - Using `req.url`, `req.method`, and `res.writeHead`
- **Serving static files**
  - Integrating `fs` module with `http` to serve files
- **Basic server lifecycle**
  - Starting a server and listening on a port (e.g., `localhost:3000`)

##  HOW TO USE THE CODES

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
````
````
2. **Navigate into the project folder**

   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. **Run the example files using Node.js**

   ```bash
   node filename.js
   ```

4. **Open in browser**

   * Visit: `http://localhost:3000/` (or the port defined in the code)

---

##  Purpose

This repository is part of my **Node.js learning journey**, focusing mainly on how to build web servers and handle requests/responses using the built-in `http` module.

---

##  Notes

* These are **practice activities** meant for learning and experimentation.
* No external frameworks (like Express.js) are used â€” only the **native HTTP module**.
